ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 2,800+ professional football players across European leagues, analyzing 160+ performance metrics (goals, assists, xG, passes, defensive stats, etc.). The goal is to uncover patterns, outliers, and role-specific trends using statistical visualizations (heatmaps, violin plots, scatter plots) to aid scouts, coaches, and analysts.

Key Questions Answered:

Which players/positions contribute most to goals and assists?

How do age, league, and squad size impact performance?
